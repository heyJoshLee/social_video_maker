**Required files: list.csv, jobs/, audio.wav**

## list.csv

Each row needs, word, def, sentence

## jobs/

Each video needs a folder named "1", '2', "3", etc...

Each of these project folders need to have an image.jpg and video.mp4 video file

## audio.wav

In the root folder. This will be used for the intro audio

## Why is this Needed?

Adding intros with relevant title cards, thumbnails, music and outros and then exporting them in a program like Sony Vegas can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes each. Per video per social channel.

This script automates the process and provides other social media assets for the creator to use.
